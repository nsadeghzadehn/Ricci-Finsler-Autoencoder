\# Ricci-driven Finsler Autoencoder (F-AE)



This repository provides the official implementation of the \*\*Ricci-driven Finsler Autoencoder (F-AE)\*\*, a geometry-aware autoencoder designed to learn \*\*direction-sensitive latent representations\*\*. The model integrates a Randers-type Finsler loss with discrete Ricci-flow smoothing to address anisotropic structures that are not captured by standard Riemannian or isotropic autoencoders.



The codebase accompanies the manuscript submitted to a Q1 journal and is intended to ensure \*\*full reproducibility of all reported experimental results\*\*, including figures and tables.
