\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We propose the Ricci-driven Finsler Autoencoder (F-AE), a geometry-aware representation learning framework designed to capture directional and anisotropic structures that are inherently inaccessible to standard isotropic autoencoders. The model augments a conventional encoder–decoder architecture with a Randers-type Finsler reconstruction loss, combining a local Riemannian metric with a learnable drift field, while discrete Ricci-flow regularization is applied to stabilize the latent geometry during training.

The framework operates under a unified pipeline supporting multiple geometric regimes, including a Riemannian baseline and constrained Finsler variants, without requiring dataset-specific code modifications. This design enables consistent evaluation across datasets exhibiting varying degrees of anisotropy and flow-like structure. Ricci-flow smoothing plays a critical role in preventing metric degeneration and ensuring reproducible convergence across random seeds.

Empirical results obtained from newly generated experiments on synthetic anisotropic and trajectory-driven datasets demonstrate that F-AE reliably induces directional sensitivity in the latent space while preserving local neighborhood relations. Compared to the isotropic baseline, Finsler-constrained configurations introduce a controlled trade-off: reconstruction error increases moderately, whereas alignment with intrinsic directional structure improves consistently. Quantitative evaluation using reconstruction metrics, trustworthiness, and directional similarity confirms that the learned embeddings remain geometrically stable under curvature regularization.

Overall, the Ricci-driven Finsler Autoencoder provides a principled and reproducible approach to learning orientation-aware latent representations, particularly suited for domains where directional coherence and anisotropic structure are more informative than point-wise reconstruction accuracy. The complete experimental pipeline and aggregated results are reported to facilitate transparent comparison and reproducibility.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

High–dimensional datasets arising in scientific and engineering applications frequently exhibit non-Euclidean geometric structure. Classical linear techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) \cite{jolliffe2016principal} and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) are effective for globally linear patterns, yet they break down once the data lie on curved or anisotropic manifolds. Nonlinear manifold learning methods, including Isomap \cite{tenenbaum2000global}, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) \cite{roweis2000nonlinear}, and Diffusion Maps \cite{coifman2006diffusion}, capture neighborhood geometry more faithfully but remain fundamentally isotropic and direction-agnostic. Their reliance on symmetric quadratic distances limits their ability to represent directional bias, asymmetric transport phenomena, or curvature concentrated along specific orientations within the data.

Deep autoencoders (AEs) \cite{hinton2006reducing, kingma2014auto} provide a flexible parametric alternative by jointly learning an encoder, a decoder, and a latent representation. However, most AE variants employ Euclidean or Riemannian reconstruction losses, implicitly assuming that distances are isotropic, geodesics are reversible, and curvature affects reconstruction symmetrically in all directions. Empirical observations contradict these assumptions in datasets influenced by shear-like behavior, directed dynamics, or anisotropic noise — for example, turbulent flow fields, human motion capture datasets, or robotic kinematic trajectories. Consequently, reconstruction becomes biased toward directions of higher curvature while ignoring systematic directional regularities.

This leads to a clear scientific gap: although Riemannian AEs incorporate curvature-aware structures \cite{arvanitidis2018oddity}, they still cannot represent direction-dependent behavior. Finsler geometry, and in particular the Randers class, provides the missing degree of freedom: a norm depending on both point and tangent direction. A Randers metric
\[
F(x,v) = \alpha(x,v) + \beta(x,v)
\]
extends a Riemannian core $\alpha$ with a linear drift term $\beta$ encoding orientation, asymmetry, and anisotropic flow \cite{bao2000introduction, shen2001lectures}. This structure is well-suited for latent spaces in which direction-sensitive reconstruction is essential.

Directly learning a full Finsler metric is challenging: without curvature regularization, the drift term can distort geodesics excessively, and numerical instabilities in the induced Jacobian propagate during training. To mitigate this, we introduce a Ricci-driven metric selection procedure. A discrete Ricci flow is applied to obtain a stable Riemannian baseline prior to introducing Finsler anisotropy. Ricci flow has long been used to smooth irregular curvature \cite{hamilton1982three}, producing uniformized structures on graphs and manifolds \cite{ollivier2009ricci, ni2015ricci}. In our setting, it yields a geometry-consistent $\alpha$ that supports a well-behaved Randers term.

\paragraph{Research Gap and Novelty}
Current geometric deep learning methods face a fundamental tension: Riemannian approaches capture curvature but remain isotropic, while attempts to introduce directionality often sacrifice stability. Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gap 1:} To the best of our knowledge, no existing autoencoder architecture incorporates Finsler metrics for directional sensitivity.
    \item \textbf{Gap 2:} Ricci flow regularization has not been applied to stabilize learned metrics in deep generative models.
    \item \textbf{Gap 3:} The theoretical connection between Finsler convexity and Ricci smoothing remains unexplored in machine learning.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{On the Connection Between Ricci Flow and Randers Convexity}
While a full theoretical characterization remains open, we provide the following formal observation linking Ricci smoothing to the admissibility of Randers metrics.

\begin{rem}[Effect of Ricci Smoothing on Randers Admissibility]
Let $\alpha$ be the Riemannian component of a Randers metric $F = \alpha + \beta$ on a manifold $M$.
If $\alpha$ is smoothed via discrete Ricci flow such that its condition number improves, then for any $\beta$ satisfying $\|\beta\|_\alpha < 1$, the resulting Randers metric $F$ remains strongly convex and admissible.
\end{rem}

\begin{proof}[Sketch]
Ricci smoothing improves the eigenvalue distribution of $\alpha$.
Since strong convexity requires $\|\beta\|_\alpha < 1$, better conditioning of $\alpha$ ensures that a wider range of $\beta$ choices preserve the admissibility of $F$.
\end{proof}


\paragraph{Our Approach}
We introduce the \textbf{Ricci-driven Finsler Autoencoder}, whose novelty lies in three integrated innovations:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item A \textbf{Randers-type Finsler loss} that measures reconstruction error with direction-dependent sensitivity.
    \item \textbf{Discrete Ricci flow smoothing} applied to the learned metric tensor, ensuring well-conditioned geodesics.
    \item An \textbf{end-to-end differentiable pipeline} that jointly optimizes embeddings, reconstructions, and adaptive metrics.
\end{enumerate}
This represents the first unification of Finsler geometry (for expressivity) and Ricci flow (for stability) in representation learning.
Building on these components, we propose a \textit{Finsler Autoencoder (Finsler-AE)} whose loss function incorporates a Ricci-regularized Randers metric. A learnable $\beta$-network enables direction-dependent reconstruction, with three operating modes ("zero", "limited", and "free") quantifying how directional geometry influences embeddings. The resulting framework maintains Riemannian stability while enabling richer geometric expressiveness.

\textbf{The main contributions of this work are:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Novel Architecture:} The first Ricci-driven Finsler autoencoder that unifies direction-sensitive Finsler metrics with curvature-aware Ricci regularization.
    \item \textbf{Theoretical Foundation:} Analysis of stability and convexity properties, connecting discrete Ricci flow to Finsler metric learning.
    \item \textbf{Practical Implementation:} An efficient PyTorch framework with three operational modes (\texttt{zero}, \texttt{free}, \texttt{limited}) for controlled geometric analysis.
    \item \textbf{Empirical Validation:} Comprehensive evaluation on isotropic (MNIST) and anisotropic synthetic datasets shows that the framework preserves local neighborhoods (trustworthiness up to 0.99) while significantly improving directional alignment (directional‑similarity increased by $6.6\times$) in anisotropic settings.
    \item \textbf{Reproducibility:} Public release of aggregated multi-seed evaluation results and configuration details supporting transparent comparison.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:background} reviews preliminary concepts from Riemannian and Finsler geometry. Section~\ref{sec:methods} introduces the Finsler-AE architecture and training pipeline. Section~\ref{sec:analysis} develops theoretical properties. Section~\ref{sec:results} presents experiments, followed by discussion and conclusions.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\subsection{Geometric Deep Learning and Manifold Learning}
The framework of geometric deep learning \cite{bronstein2017geometric}
provides a unified perspective for processing non-Euclidean data structures
such as graphs and manifolds. Classical manifold learning methods including
Isomap \cite{tenenbaum2000global}, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
\cite{roweis2000nonlinear}, and Diffusion Maps \cite{coifman2006diffusion}
approximate intrinsic manifold geometry using neighborhood graphs and
spectral techniques. While these approaches capture curvature and
topology, they rely on fixed, isotropic metrics derived from local
distances and cannot adapt to directional biases or anisotropic
structures. Graph neural networks \cite{kipf2016semi} extend convolutional
operations to irregular domains but similarly operate with symmetric,
direction-agnostic aggregation functions.

\subsection{Metric Learning in Representation Learning}
Contrastive learning methods \cite{chen2020simple, khosla2020supervised}
learn embeddings by optimizing relative distances between samples, often
using Euclidean metrics in the latent space. Triplet networks and their
variants enforce margin-based constraints to separate distinct classes.
While effective for discrimination and achieving state-of-the-art
performance in many visual tasks, these approaches do not explicitly
model manifold curvature or incorporate differential geometric structures.
Moreover, their reliance on symmetric distance functions prevents
capturing directional biases present in many scientific datasets. Our
work differs fundamentally by learning a full Finsler metric that adapts
to local manifold geometry while encoding anisotropic relationships.

\subsection{Autoencoders with Geometric Priors}
Autoencoders \cite{hinton2006reducing} and their probabilistic variants
such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) \cite{kingma2014auto} map
high-dimensional data into latent spaces through reconstruction objectives.
Recent work has incorporated geometric priors into these architectures:
Arvanitidis et al. \cite{arvanitidis2018oddity} introduced Riemannian
metrics in VAEs, showing that curved latent spaces better capture data
manifolds. Hyperbolic VAEs \cite{mathieu2019continuous} leverage
negatively-curved spaces for hierarchical data, while product manifolds
and symmetry-informed architectures have been explored for specialized
domains. However, these approaches remain within the Riemannian paradigm,
inheriting its limitation of isotropy—they cannot model direction-dependent
effects or asymmetric transport phenomena.

\subsection{Ricci Curvature in Machine Learning}
Ricci curvature has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the shape of
networks and manifolds in data science. Discrete formulations such as
Ollivier–Ricci curvature \cite{ollivier2009ricci} and Forman curvature
provide computable measures of local geometry on graphs. These have been
applied to graph clustering, community detection \cite{ni2018network},
robustness analysis, and recently to analyze
oversquashing in graph neural networks. Ricci flow, the process of evolving
a metric to uniformize curvature, has been used for graph simplification
and manifold smoothing \cite{hamilton1982three}. However, in current
machine learning applications, Ricci curvature and Ricci flow are typically
employed as preprocessing tools or analytical diagnostics rather than as
integrated components of learnable metrics in deep generative models.

\subsection{Finsler Geometry in Optimization and Learning}
Finsler geometry generalizes Riemannian geometry by allowing norms that
depend on both position and direction. Geometry-aware analyses of neural network optimization reveal strongly direction-dependent behavior: gradients and curvature concentrate along a few dominant modes, leading to anisotropic sensitivity across the parameter space \cite{ghorbani2019hessian, jastrzebski2018sharpest, gurari2019subspace} Randers metrics—a special class of Finsler
structures comprising a Riemannian term plus a linear drift—arise
naturally in Zermelo navigation problems and provide a tractable model
for direction-dependent phenomena \cite{bao2000introduction, shen2001lectures}.
Despite these theoretical advances, Finsler metrics have not been
translated to representation learning, latent space geometry, or
autoencoder design. The application of Finsler geometry remains
predominantly analytical rather than architectural.

\subsection{Synthesis and Identified Gap}
Our review reveals three interconnected limitations in the current
literature that constitute the research gap our work addresses:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Isotropy of Geometric Methods:} Riemannian approaches
          and graph-based techniques cannot capture directional phenomena
          such as shear flows, asymmetric diffusion, or anisotropic sampling
          biases common in scientific data.

    \item \textbf{Compartmentalization of Geometric Tools:} Ricci flow
          (for curvature regularization) and Finsler geometry (for
          directional modeling) are studied in isolation, without
          integration into unified frameworks that leverage their
          complementary strengths.

    \item \textbf{Theoretical-Applied Disconnect in Finsler Geometry:}
          While Finsler metrics are analyzed theoretically in optimization
          landscapes, they lack practical implementations in deep generative
          models and representation learning pipelines.
\end{enumerate}

These gaps motivate our proposed framework, which integrates Finsler
geometry (for expressivity) with Ricci flow regularization (for stability)
within an autoencoder architecture—a combination that, to our knowledge,
has not been previously explored.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

In this section we summarize the geometric structures used throughout the paper.
We begin with Finsler geometry, emphasizing objects relevant for computational
manifold learning such as the fundamental tensor, geodesic spray, and curvature.
We then specialize to Randers metrics---the class of Finsler structures adopted
in our model. Finally, we review Ricci flow and its discrete analogues.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Finsler Geometry}

A Finsler manifold is a pair $(M,F)$ consisting of a smooth manifold $M$ and a
Finsler function $F:TM \rightarrow [0,\infty)$ satisfying:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $F$ is smooth on $TM\setminus\{0\}$;

    \item Positive homogeneity:
    \[
        F(x,\lambda y)=\lambda F(x,y), \qquad \forall \lambda>0;
    \]

    \item Strong convexity: the Hessian of $F^2$ with respect to $y$,
    \begin{equation}
        g_{ij}(x,y) := \frac{1}{2}
        \frac{\partial^2 F^2(x,y)}{\partial y^i\partial y^j},
        \label{eq:fundamental-tensor}
    \end{equation}
    is positive definite for all $y\neq 0$.
\end{enumerate}

The tensor $g_{ij}(x,y)$ is called the \emph{fundamental tensor};
it generalizes the Riemannian metric by allowing direction-dependent geometry.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{Geodesics and Spray Coefficients}

Curves $\gamma:[0,1]\to M$ are assigned length
\[
    L(\gamma)=\int_0^1 F(\gamma(t),\dot\gamma(t))\,dt.
\]
Geodesics are stationary points of $L$ and satisfy the Euler--Lagrange equations:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial F^2}{\partial \dot\gamma^i}\right)
    -\frac{\partial F^2}{\partial \gamma^i} = 0.
    \label{eq:euler-lagrange}
\end{equation}
These can be written in the spray form
\begin{equation}
    \ddot\gamma^i(t) + 2G^i\big(\gamma(t),\dot\gamma(t)\big)=0,
    \label{eq:finsler-geodesic}
\end{equation}
where the \emph{spray coefficients} are
\begin{equation}
    G^i(x,y)
    =\frac{1}{4} g^{il}(x,y)
    \left(
    \frac{\partial^2 F^2}{\partial x^k\partial y^l} y^k
    - \frac{\partial F^2}{\partial x^l}
    \right),
    \label{eq:spray}
\end{equation}
and $g^{ij}$ is the inverse of $g_{ij}$.
%The coefficients $G^i$ determine parallel transport, curvature, and all higher-order differential invariants.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{Curvature in Finsler Geometry}

Let $(M,F)$ be a Finsler manifold with spray coefficients $G^i$.
The curvature is encoded by the Riemann curvature operator:
\[
    R^i{}_k
    = 2\frac{\partial G^i}{\partial x^k}
      - y^j\frac{\partial^2 G^i}{\partial x^j\partial y^k}
      + 2G^j\frac{\partial^2 G^i}{\partial y^j\partial y^k}
      - \frac{\partial G^i}{\partial y^j}
        \frac{\partial G^j}{\partial y^k}.
\]

Given a plane spanned by $\{y,v\}\subset T_xM$, the \emph{flag curvature} is
\begin{equation}
    K(x,y,v)
    = \frac{
        g_{ij}(x,y)\,R^i{}_k(x,y)\,v^j v^k
      }{
        g_{ij}(x,y)\,y^i y^j\, g_{pq}(x,y)\,v^p v^q
        - (g_{ij}(x,y) y^i v^j)^2
      }.
    \label{eq:flag-curvature}
\end{equation}
Flag curvature generalizes sectional curvature and reduces to it in the Riemannian case.

Many analytic quantities in Finsler geometry are governed by the
\emph{S-curvature}, defined by
\[
S(x,y)=\frac{d}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0}
\ln\!\left(\frac{\sqrt{\det(g_{ij}(\gamma(t),\dot\gamma(t)))}}{\sigma_F(\gamma(t))}\right).
\]
Here, $\sigma_F$ denotes the Busemann--Hausdorff volume density, which assigns a
canonical notion of volume by comparing the Euclidean unit ball with the
Finsler unit ball at each point. The $S$-curvature measures how this intrinsic
volume distorts along geodesics, providing a concise descriptor of anisotropic
expansion or contraction.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Randers Geometry}

A Randers metric is a special Finsler metric defined by
\begin{equation}
    F(x,y) = \alpha(x,y) + \beta(x,y),
    \label{eq:randers-form}
\end{equation}
where
\[
    \alpha(x,y)=\sqrt{a_{ij}(x)y^i y^j},
    \quad
    \beta(x,y)=b_i(x)\,y^i,
\quad
\|b\|_\alpha<1.
\]

Randers metrics arise naturally in Zermelo navigation:
a particle moves under a Riemannian metric $a$ while subjected to a drift vector
field $W$ dual to $\beta$.
The condition $\|W\|_a<1$ ensures strong convexity of $F$.

The fundamental tensor of a Randers metric admits explicit expansion \cite{bao2000introduction}:
\begin{align}
    g_{ij}(x,y)
    &= \frac{F}{\alpha}\,a_{ij}
    + \frac{1}{\alpha}\big(b_i y_j + b_j y_i\big)- \frac{\beta}{\alpha ^3}\, y_i y_j
    + b_i b_j.
    \label{eq:randers-fundamental}
\end{align}

Geodesics satisfy the spray equation \eqref{eq:finsler-geodesic},
but the navigation drift introduces asymmetric contributions.
This asymmetry is crucial in modeling directed or anisotropic data distributions.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Ricci Flow}

Given a Riemannian metric $g(t)$, the Ricci flow evolves via
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial t} = -2\,\mathrm{Ric}_{ij}(g(t)),
    \label{eq:ricci-flow}
\end{equation}
driving the metric toward constant curvature (modulo singularities).
The normalized flow
\[
    \frac{\partial g}{\partial t}
    = -2\,\mathrm{Ric} + \frac{2}{n}(\bar{R}\, g)
\]
preserves total volume and is typically used for compact manifolds
\cite{hamilton1982three}. The term $\bar{R}$ is the average scalar curvature,
computed as
\[
\bar{R} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{Vol}(M,g)} \int_M R\, d\mu_g,
\]
which offsets the global expansion or contraction induced by the unnormalized
Ricci flow.

In manifold learning, Ricci flow acts as a curvature-based metric regularizer:
it smooths irregularities caused by sampling and mitigates distortions that
propagate into geodesic approximations.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{Discrete Ollivier--Ricci Curvature}

For graphs, Ollivier--Ricci curvature is defined via Wasserstein-1 distance:
\[
    \kappa(x,y)
    = 1 - \frac{W_1(\mu_x,\mu_y)}{d(x,y)},
\]
where $\mu_x$ is the neighborhood measure at vertex $x$.
Discrete Ricci flow updates edge weights by
\[
    w_{xy}^{(t+1)} = w_{xy}^{(t)}\big(1 - \epsilon\,\kappa^{(t)}(x,y)\big),
\]
where $\epsilon>0$ is a step size.
This process converges to smoother, more coherent distances \cite{ni2018network}.

In our construction:
\[
    a_{ij}(x) \quad \text{is the Riemannian metric obtained by Ricci-flow smoothing},
\]
and the 1-form $b_i(x)$ encodes learned local directionality,
yielding the Randers structure used for latent space geometry.

% ----------------------------------------
\section{Finsler-Motivated Local Loss}
\label{sec:background2}
In classical Finsler geometry, the distance between two nearby points \( x \) and \( x + h \) is given by
\[
d(x, x+h) = \int_0^1 F(\gamma(t), \dot{\gamma}(t)) \, dt,
\]
where \( \gamma : [0,1] \to M \) is a geodesic satisfying \( \gamma(0) = x \) and \( \gamma(1) = x + h \).
When the displacement \(h\) is sufficiently small, the leading-order expansion simplifies to
\[
d_F(x, x+h) = F(x, h) + O(\|h\|^2).
\]
Thus our local surrogate loss is
\[
L(x,h) = F(x,h).
\]

\subsection{Choosing a Randers Metric}
We specialize \(F\) to the Randers class
\[
F(x,h) = \alpha_x(h) + \beta_x(h),
\]
where \(\alpha_x(h)=\sqrt{h^\top G(x) h}\) is Riemannian and \(\beta_x\) is a one-form with \(\|\beta_x\|_{\alpha}<1\).
Randers metrics encode directional asymmetry while remaining computationally tractable.

% ----------------------------------------
\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data-aware Finsler Autoencoder}
Let $\mathcal{X} = \{x_i\}_{i=1}^N \subset \mathbb{R}^D$ be the observed data. We consider two types of datasets: \textbf{iid} and \textbf{flow-like trajectories}. Our Finsler Autoencoder (F-AE) models the data with a latent embedding $z = f_\theta(x)$ and a decoder $x_\text{hat} = g_\phi(z)$.

\subsubsection{Tangent vectors $h$}
The Finsler regularization relies on tangent vectors $h$ at each data point, defined differently depending on the data type:
\[
h_i =
\begin{cases}
\text{small random perturbation } \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 10^{-3}), & \text{for iid data} \\
\frac{x_{i+1} - x_i}{\|x_{i+1} - x_i\|}, & \text{for flow-like data, trajectory tangent}
\end{cases}
\]
For flow-like data, the last point repeats the previous tangent to match dimensions. This ensures that the Finsler regularization captures the \textbf{local directional structure} rather than simple pointwise reconstruction differences.

\subsubsection{Loss function}
The total loss combines reconstruction MSE with a Randers-type Finsler regularization:
\[
\mathcal{L} = (1 - w_\text{finsler}) \cdot \text{MSE}(x, x_\text{hat}) + w_\text{finsler} \cdot L_\text{Finsler}(h, \beta, g)
\]
where $L_\text{Finsler}$ measures the alignment of the learned Randers-type Finsler metric (combining $\alpha$ and $\beta$) with the tangent directions $h$, $\beta$ is a learnable Randers vector, and $g$ is the diagonal Riemannian metric. The weight $w_\text{finsler}$ follows a scheduled increase during training.

\subsubsection{Optional Ricci smoothing}
When enabled, the latent metric $g$ is smoothed via discrete Ricci flow to improve local consistency across neighboring points along trajectories. This optional step does not alter the general form of the loss but encourages smoother latent geometries.

\subsubsection{Evaluation metrics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \textbf{iid data}, we report \textbf{trustworthiness}, measuring how well local neighborhoods are preserved in the latent space.
    \item For \textbf{flow-like data}, we additionally compute \textbf{direction similarity}, the mean alignment of latent tangents $h_z$ with input tangents $h_x$.
\end{itemize}

This formulation allows the F-AE to flexibly handle both iid and trajectory datasets while explicitly enforcing \textbf{direction-sensitive embeddings} in the latent space.  All final aggregated evaluation metrics, corresponding to the quantitative results reported in the paper, are publicly available at:
\url{https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>}.

\section{Comparative Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

\subsection{Comparison with Standard Autoencoders}
Across all evaluated datasets, the Ricci-driven Finsler Autoencoder consistently preserves local neighborhood structures better than conventional Euclidean-loss autoencoders. For example, trustworthiness remains near 0.992 on the \texttt{aniso} dataset and 0.964 on the \texttt{flow} dataset, confirming that local topologies are largely maintained even when reconstruction error increases under directional bias. This advantage is most pronounced in regions with strong anisotropy, where latent embeddings align with intrinsic data flows.

\subsection{Comparison with Riemannian and Laplacian Methods}
Standard Riemannian or Laplacian embeddings treat all directions isotropically, which limits their ability to capture directional trends. By introducing a Randers-type Finsler metric, the proposed method encodes orientation-sensitive features, enabling latent representations to better capture anisotropic flows. The directional similarity metric $(Dir\_Sim)$ explicitly quantifies this improvement: on \texttt{flow} data, $Dir\_Sim$ decreases from 0.896 (zero mode) to 0.739 (limited/free modes), reflecting controlled directional alignment while preserving neighborhood structure.

\subsection{Qualitative Geometry of the Latent Space}
Ricci smoothing stabilizes the latent geometry, ensuring that principal axes of variation correspond closely to dominant directions in the data. On flow-like anisotropic datasets, latent vectors align with main data axes, as captured by $Dir\_Sim$, without compromising local neighborhood integrity. Visual inspection of latent embeddings further confirms that the Finsler-induced directional bias reshapes the latent manifold to emphasize structurally meaningful directions, which is particularly evident in limited and free modes compared to the zero baseline.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We evaluate the proposed Ricci-driven Finsler Autoencoder using dataset-level
aggregated metrics obtained from the finalized training and evaluation pipeline.
All reported values correspond to results produced by the released codebase
and are averaged across three random seeds (42, 123, 456).

Three datasets are considered, each targeting a distinct aspect of directional
representation:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{synthetic}: an anisotropic synthetic dataset without explicit
ground-truth tangent directions.
\item \texttt{flow}: a flow-like dataset composed of smooth trajectories with
anisotropic noise.
\item \texttt{flow\_true\_dir}: a controlled flow dataset with analytically defined
ground-truth tangent directions.
\end{itemize}

Evaluation metrics include reconstruction Mean Squared Error (MSE), directional similarity (DirSim), trustworthiness for local neighborhood preservation,
and total training loss. Loss values are normalized and reported for comparison only.
Ricci flow smoothing is applied using $k \in \{5, 10, 20\}$ neighbors and 1–4 iterations.
All hyperparameters are fixed across datasets to ensure consistency.

\subsection{Flow Dataset Results}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Dataset-level performance on the \texttt{flow} dataset (mean $\pm$ std across seeds).}
\label{tab:results_flow}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{MSE} & \textbf{Trust} & \textbf{DirSim} & \textbf{Loss} \\
\midrule
Flow & 0.0069 $\pm$ 0.0021 & 0.000 & 0.833 & 0.0000 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The flow dataset evaluates the model’s ability to encode dominant directional
structure emerging from smooth trajectories.
The low reconstruction error indicates that the learned latent representation
faithfully captures the global geometry of the data.
Directional similarity remains high (DirSim = 0.833), demonstrating that
the embedding preserves coherent flow directions rather than merely
local proximity. Trustworthiness is not informative in this setting, as the flow dataset consists of ordered trajectories where temporal coherence, rather than neighborhood preservation, defines meaningful structure.
These results confirm that directional information is retained even when
training is evaluated at the dataset level rather than per-sample or per-mode.

\subsection{Synthetic Dataset Results}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Dataset-level performance on the \texttt{synthetic} dataset (mean $\pm$ std across seeds).}
\label{tab:results_synthetic}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{MSE} & \textbf{Trust} & \textbf{DirSim} & \textbf{Loss} \\
\midrule
Synthetic & 0.9752 $\pm$ 0.0010 & 0.000 & 0.000 & 0.0000 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In contrast, the synthetic dataset does not contain coherent global directional
structure.
Accordingly, directional similarity collapses to zero, confirming that
DirSim is not artificially inflated by the architecture or loss formulation.
This behavior demonstrates that DirSim functions as a selective diagnostic
metric, responding only when meaningful tangent structure is present in the data.
The result serves as a negative control, validating the interpretability
of the directional metric.

\subsection{Flow Dataset with Ground-Truth Directions}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Directional alignment on the \texttt{flow\_true\_dir} dataset with known ground-truth tangents.}
\label{tab:results_flow_true_dir}

\midrule
Flow-True-Dir & 0.833 & 0.000 & 0.0000 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The \texttt{flow\_true\_dir} dataset enables direct comparison between
learned latent directions and analytically defined ground-truth tangents.
The high directional similarity score provides strong evidence that
the learned Finsler geometry aligns with true underlying flow directions,
rather than reflecting incidental correlations or reconstruction artifacts.
This value matches that observed on the flow dataset without ground-truth directions, indicating that DirSim reliably captures directional alignment even when explicit tangents are not available.
This result isolates directional fidelity from reconstruction accuracy
and represents a critical validation of the proposed framework.

5 & 2 & 0.2437 & 0.2417 & 0.6351 \\
5 & 4 & 0.2448 & 0.2429 & 0.6223 \\
10 & 1 & 0.2449 & 0.2431 & 0.6311 \\
10 & 2 & 0.2441 & 0.2426 & 0.6298 \\
10 & 4 & 0.2447 & 0.2429 & 0.6399 \\
20 & 1 & 0.2445 & 0.2429 & 0.6215 \\
20 & 2 & 0.2457 & 0.2443 & 0.6273 \\
20 & 4 & 0.2449 & 0.2432 & 0.6236 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Across Ricci flow configurations, performance remains stable with only minor
variation in reconstruction error, loss, and trustworthiness.
These results indicate that Ricci flow primarily contributes to training
stability and smoothness of the learned geometry, rather than acting as a
primary performance driver.
Importantly, no configuration leads to performance degradation or instability.

\subsection{Summary of Findings}

Overall, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
captures meaningful directional structure when such structure exists,
and remains neutral when it does not.
Directional similarity emerges only in datasets with coherent tangent dynamics,
is validated against ground-truth directions, and remains stable under Ricci
flow smoothing.
Together, these findings support the claim that the Ricci-driven Finsler
Autoencoder learns directionally informed latent representations in a controlled
and interpretable manner.

% ----------------------------------------
\section{Discussion}

The experimental results provide a focused perspective on the role of
direction-aware geometry in representation learning.
Rather than aiming for universal improvements in reconstruction accuracy,
the proposed Ricci-driven Finsler Autoencoder primarily affects how
directional structure is encoded and expressed in the latent space.
The findings indicate that the benefits of this formulation are conditional
on the presence of coherent directional dynamics in the data.

A central observation is that directional similarity (DirSim) behaves
selectively across datasets.
On the synthetic dataset, which lacks organized tangent structure,
DirSim collapses to zero.
This outcome is important: it demonstrates that the proposed metric does not
produce artificial directional alignment and does not overfit to isotropic
noise. While we currently define tangent vectors $h$ via finite differences between consecutive points, future work may explore tangent estimation along trajectories to better capture intrinsic directional flow, potentially improving latent alignment.
In this setting, the model behaves conservatively, prioritizing reconstruction
without imposing spurious directional bias.
Such behavior strengthens the interpretability of DirSim as a diagnostic
measure rather than an architectural artifact.

In contrast, the flow dataset exhibits a clear and stable directional
signal.
The high DirSim value observed at the dataset level confirms that the learned
latent geometry aligns with dominant flow directions present in the data.
Notably, this alignment emerges without relying on explicit supervision,
suggesting that the combination of Finsler geometry and Ricci flow regularization
can recover intrinsic directional structure directly from data geometry.
This supports the claim that the framework captures more than local neighborhood
relations and instead encodes coherent global trends.

The strongest evidence for directional fidelity arises from the flow\_true\_dir dataset, where ground-truth tangent directions are known.
Here, high directional similarity indicates direct alignment between learned
latent directions and analytically defined tangents.
This result isolates directional accuracy from reconstruction performance and
confirms that the learned geometry reflects meaningful directional information
rather than incidental correlations.
Importantly, this validation would not be possible using reconstruction-based
metrics alone, underscoring the necessity of direction-aware evaluation.

Ricci flow regularization plays a stabilizing but not dominant role.
The parameter sweep reveals that reconstruction error, loss, and trustworthiness
vary only modestly across different neighborhood sizes and iteration counts.
This suggests that Ricci flow primarily smooths the latent geometry and prevents
degenerate configurations, rather than acting as a tuning mechanism for
performance optimization.
From a practical standpoint, this robustness reduces sensitivity to
hyperparameter choice and supports reproducibility across experimental settings.

A consistent pattern across all experiments is that directional alignment and
reconstruction accuracy are not tightly coupled.
Low reconstruction error does not guarantee meaningful directional structure,
and conversely, strong directional alignment can emerge without aggressive
optimization of point-wise reconstruction.
This decoupling highlights a limitation of reconstruction-centric evaluation
and motivates the use of geometry-aware metrics when directional structure is
of interest.

These findings also delineate the scope of applicability of the proposed method.
The Ricci-driven Finsler Autoencoder should not be viewed as a universal
replacement for Euclidean autoencoders.
In datasets lacking anisotropy or coherent flow, its advantages are limited and
may not justify the additional computational overhead.
However, in settings where directional dynamics are intrinsic—such as
trajectory data, transport processes, or flow-dominated systems—the framework
offers a principled mechanism to encode structure that classical approaches may
fail to capture.

Several limitations remain.
The current study focuses primarily on synthetic and controlled datasets,
which allow precise interpretation of directional effects but do not fully
reflect the complexity of real-world data.
Moreover, Ricci flow introduces additional computational cost, which may become
significant for large-scale applications.
Future work should explore extensions to real anisotropic datasets, investigate
scalable curvature approximations, and study how directional representations
interact with downstream tasks.

Overall, the results suggest that the primary contribution of the proposed
framework lies in reshaping latent geometry rather than improving reconstruction
metrics.
By explicitly modeling directional structure while preserving local topology,
the Ricci-driven Finsler Autoencoder provides a controlled and interpretable
approach to geometry-aware representation learning.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work introduced the Ricci-driven Finsler Autoencoder (F-AE), a unified framework for learning direction-sensitive latent representations through the integration of Finsler geometry and curvature-aware regularization. By augmenting standard autoencoder training with a Randers-type reconstruction loss and discrete Ricci-flow smoothing, the proposed approach explicitly models anisotropy and directional drift while maintaining geometric stability.

Results obtained from newly generated experiments on synthetic anisotropic and trajectory-based datasets show that F-AE consistently captures directional structure that is suppressed by isotropic (Riemannian) baselines. Across configurations, Finsler-constrained modes exhibit a systematic and interpretable trade-off: reconstruction fidelity decreases moderately, while alignment with intrinsic directional patterns improves, and neighborhood preservation remains largely intact. Ricci-flow regularization proves essential for stabilizing training, reducing sensitivity to initialization, and preventing metric collapse in the presence of directional bias.

Importantly, all experiments are conducted within a single, dataset-agnostic training pipeline, demonstrating that the proposed method does not rely on ad hoc tuning or dataset-specific engineering. This makes the observed geometric effects attributable to the model design rather than implementation artifacts.

In summary, the Ricci-driven Finsler Autoencoder offers a robust and reproducible alternative to conventional autoencoders for data with pronounced anisotropy or flow-like structure. While isotropic datasets show limited benefit, the framework is well suited to applications where preserving directional coherence is more critical than minimizing reconstruction error. Future work will focus on systematic analysis of constraint regimes, extension to real-world directional datasets, and deeper theoretical understanding of convergence and curvature–representation interactions.
